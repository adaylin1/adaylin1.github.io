## Introduction
Python and R are both programming languages that are extremely useful for data wrangling and analysis, especially in the realm of computational biology and bioinformatics. Some examples of this can be seen below.

## R and Python
I will be starting in R by assigning the follow string of characters to `TheBestest`
```{r}
library(reticulate)
TheBestest <- "Fearless (Taylor's Version) by Taylor Swift"
``` 
As we can see, Ungodly Hour is indeed the best album of 2020.


Next, I will be switching to python, and save a different string of characters as `Truth`. Then, I am going to print out these strings together in the same python code chunk by using the print function.
